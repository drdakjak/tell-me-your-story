Ensure that the header includes a title or a brief professional summary that aligns with the job post, such as \\\"Software Developer with Machine Learning Expertise.\\\"\\n\\n   b) **ATS compatibility**: \\n   - The contact information is generally ATS-friendly. However, ensure that the email and LinkedIn URL are hyperlinked in digital formats, as some ATS may parse links differently. Also, consider using a professional email address that includes your name for a more polished appearance.\\n\\n   c) **Overall appeal to human reviewers**: \\n   - The contact information is straightforward, but adding a professional title or a brief tagline can enhance its appeal. For example, \\\"Jakub Drdak | Software Developer | Machine Learning Enthusiast\\\" can make a stronger first impression.\\n\\n2. **Overall score on the scale of 1-10**: \\n   - **Score: 5/10**. The section is functional but lacks elements that would make it stand out to both ATS and human reviewers. Adding a professional title and ensuring a polished presentation would improve its effectiveness.\"}",
